## Prompt:

Asking good questions is a valuable skill to have - asking questions in an online setting is both easier and harder than asking questions in person: we can prepare to ask a question but we are also expected to prepare.
The links posted here give some advice on how to ask good questions:

- stackoverflow's [Asking a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

- R's [Posting guidelines](https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html)

- [minimal complete verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)

Follow these links and read through the advice given, then

1. **Pick at least one question from stackoverflow or the R help and answer it.**

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

2. **Document which question you answered (link to your answer).**

3. **Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading. **


My Blog:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244319/r-how-to-use-group-by-function-properly/70868821#70868821

So this person used all the correct guidelines when asking their question. The title was short and simple and summarized the problem at hand. 
I was aware of what function they needed help with. As for the question itself, the person did not specifically state their question. 
However, they did say what their problem was with their code so it made it easy for me to answer it. They included the code and what went wrong with it.

All in all I thought the question was asked very concisely and neatly, making it easy to answer for me. I told the perosn what they were doing wrong and included the new corrected code.
